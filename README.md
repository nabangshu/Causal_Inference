# CausalInference

This repository contains the code for all work on Causal Inference that I have done/am doing.

Causal_Inference.R contains the code for comparison between Google's CausalImpact with synthetic control groups and Vanilla DD with standard error clustering. This is the code used in the papers:

- "Advancing Causal Inference: Differences-in-Differences vs. Bayesian Structural Time Series Models", 2021 Academy of Management Annual Meeting
- "Towards Temporal Causal Inference: A Review of Differences-in-Differences Applications in Strategic Management", Strategic Management Society 41st Annual Conference, 2021

## Dependencies
- Built using R version 4.0.2
- Libraries: CausalImpact
